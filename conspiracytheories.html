    <h5> It's well known among many people from all over the world that strange
and sometimes unexplainable events happen all the time. Although science has been able to debunk
most conspiracies and in turn crush the hearts of hundreds of theorists, there are still
generous amounts of events recorded that science just can't explain. Here are 4 very confusing theories
from all around the world. With these it's important to keep an open mind.

  <li>  <h1> Mattress Firm </h1> </li>
    <p> Mattress Firm has been under the radar of many people not because of the quality of their mattresses but because
    they have so many stores, sometimes just around a corner. A commenter on Reddit suggested that Mattress Firm could perhaps be a money
  laundering operation, and it kind of makes sense. They mentioned that mattresses are not that high in demand and consumers
usually purchase a mattress every 7-10 years, so why are there so many Mattress Firms? Recently on October 5, 2018, the CEO said that
Mattress Firm would be closing stores that are "in close proximity" of one another. They will be closing up to 700 stores. </p>

    <li> <h1> Area 51 </h1> </li>
    <p> Area 51 was a secret U.S Airforce military installation located by Groom Lake in South Nevada. <br/>
      I say "was" only because the government acknowledged area 51's existence back in 2013 so it's not that <br/>
      secret anymore. It is theorized that Area 51 is a place where the government hides extraterrestrial <br/>
    life and information from the public. The government continuously denied involvement in searching for UFO's and aliens, <br/>
  but they did confirm that they had a $22 million program dedicated to the research of UFO's.  </p>

    <li><h1> Chemtrails </h1> </li>
    <p> The word "chemtrails" means chemical trails and there are people out there that believe that the white lines that <br/>
    can sometimes seen in the sky come from airplanes that spra chemicals that will allow the government to either mind control us, shorten life expectancy, <br/>
  or even for controlling the weather. This one reall doesn't have any concrete evidence which is why not a lot of people agree with it </p>

  <li>  <h1> The Mandela Effect </h1> </li>
    <p> The Mandela Effect is regarded as a phenomenon that occurs when a large group of people remembers an event or certain things <br/>
    as something that never happened or was never there. Some examples include the Berenstein vs Berenstain bears, the Oscar Meyer vs Oscar Mayer brand, <br/>
  the "Luke I am your father" vs. the "No, I am your father," the "Mirror mirror on the wall" vs. the "Magic mirror on the wall," etc. Many people <br/>
strongly believe that everytime we remember something different than what it actually is, that we are traveling through an alternate dimension where <br/>
what we remember is actually correct. </p>
