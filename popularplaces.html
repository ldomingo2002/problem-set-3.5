  <h1> <li> Stonehenge</li></h1>
  <p> Stonehenge can be found in England and it is known for the large 45 ton rocks that are placesd on top and around <br/>
  each other. The size of the rocks just makes it seem as though humans weren't the ones that placed them there. It was <br/>
estimated that thousands of people helped place those rocks while others say that the process was sped up with help from <br/>
aliens. </p>

  <h1><li> The Nasca lines </li></h1>
  <p> The lines of Nasca are located at the Southern border of Peru in a desert. The lines are famous because they formed <br/>
  into complex forms and figures but of a significantly large scale. many people say that aliens are the cause of these lines. <br/>
There is yet to be an explanation but one is able to travel and see the lines in person. </p>

  <h1><li> The Extraterrestrial Highway</li></h1>
  <p> In 1947 arond Roswell,New Mexico, there had been news of a balloon crash on a ranch. The owner of the ranch had initially said that <br/>
  the object had looked like some sort of flying saucer and had even collected a sample of the object, which he said looked unlike any metal <br/>
he had ever seen before. The government had later collected the piece of metal from the rancher and threatened him so that he changed his <br/>
to make it sound like it was a balloon crash. You can visit the site and see exactly where the suspected UFO crashed. </p>

  <h1><li> Easter Island </li></h1>
  <p> Easter Island,located in a Chilean island, is known for their maoi, or for the huge carved statues that sit on the island. <br/>
  The statues are carved from volcanic rocks and the history of the island is passed down orally, but the history regarding these <br/>
statues has been lost and continues to be a mytery to archaeologists. Nonetheless, it is a beautiful place to travel to and they <br/>
have more activities to choose from besides the maoi. </p>
